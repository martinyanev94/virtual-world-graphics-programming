# Final Project: Creating a Virtual World with Interactive Animation

## Project Overview

This project encourages students to apply the concepts learned throughout the course in game animation programming using OpenGL and Vulkan. Students will create a simple virtual world that features animated characters (instances) and basic navigation.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, students will be able to:
- Implement animated instances in a virtual environment.
- Use collision detection to enhance interaction between instances and the environment.
- Implement basic AI behavior for the instances.
- Create a navigation system utilizing pathfinding algorithms.

## Project Requirements

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Choose either OpenGL or Vulkan for the graphics rendering.
   - Use the provided example code as a base for your project.

2. **Create a Virtual World**
   - Design a simple level using 3D modeling software (e.g., Blender).
   - Load the level data into your application and display it using your chosen graphics API.

3. **Implement Animated Instances**
   - Load and display character models with basic animations such as walking and idle states.
   - Implement an animation controller that allows for state transitions between walking and idle based on user input.

4. **Add Collision Detection**
   - Use bounding volumes (e.g., Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to detect collisions between instances and the environment.
   - Implement logic to prevent instances from walking through walls or falling off the level.

5. **Implement AI Behavior**
   - Allow instances to navigate the environment using a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm).
   - Implement simple AI behavior where instances move towards the player or patrol predefined waypoints.

6. **User Interaction**
   - Implement a selection system that allows users to click on instances to interact with them.
   - Display information about the selected instance in a UI overlay.

7. **Enhancements (Optional)**
   - Add additional animations such as jumping or running.
   - Implement visual effects like particle systems for footsteps or interactions.
   - Create a more complex AI behavior with different states (e.g., searching, fleeing).
   - Implement a sound system to add sound effects to interactions and background music.

## Submission Guidelines

- Ensure all code is well-commented and organized.
- Submit a zip file containing the source code and any relevant assets (models, textures).
- Provide a short video demonstration of your virtual world, showcasing the animations, AI behaviors, and interactions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of the project requirements (animations, AI, collisions).
- Quality and organization of the code.
- Creativity in the design of the virtual world and the implementation of interactions.
- Functionality and performance of the application.

Good luck, and enjoy creating your virtual world!
